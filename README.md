# Restaurant Review App

## Project Overview
The main goal for this project was to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Hence I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted same to be responsive on different sized display, accessible (using proper semantics and ARIA labels) for all screen readers and caches in a static site for offline use using ServiceWorker element and Cache API.

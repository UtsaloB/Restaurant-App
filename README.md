# Restaurant Review App

## Project Description
The main goal for this project was to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Hence I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted same to be responsive on different sized display, accessible (using proper semantics and ARIA labels) for all screen readers and caches in a static site for offline use using ServiceWorker element and Cache API.

## Installation
* To run the project, Clone/download repo into your computer: `https://github.com/UtsaloB/Restaurant-App`
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have using this command: `python -v`
* Then launch a local client server using Python from your terminal. Depending on the version of Python on your system, use the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` for version2.x and `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

## Running the Tests
* With your server still running, visit the site on your browser at `http://localhost:8000` to view the app.
* After opening site, it can be tested on diffrent screen modes from the developer tool and adjusting the screen size.
* it can also be tested for functionality offline while server is off.
